== Java CompletableFuture API - A Code kata

image:assets/images/DukeCompletableFuture.png[Duke with Back to the Future Car]

`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture` is a versatile utility in Java (since Java 8).It provides a means of task execution, both synchronous and asynchronous.

A CompletableFuture implements `java.util.concurrent.Future` (available since Java 5) and `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage` (available since Java 8) and adds additional methods for operating on tasks.

Some additional documentation about the three in this kata:

* link:assets/docs/Future.adoc[Future]
* link:assets/docs/CompletionStage.adoc[CompletionStage]
* link:assets/docs/CompletableFuture.adoc[CompletableFuture]

A special lookup for exception handling:
