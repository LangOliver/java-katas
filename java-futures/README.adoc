`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture` is a versatile utility in Java (since Java 8).It provides a means of task execution, both synchronous and asynchronous.

A CompletableFuture implements `java.util.concurrent.Future` (available since Java 5) and `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage` (available since Java 8) and adds additional methods for operating on tasks.

Some additional documentation about the three in this kata:

* link:assets/docs/Future.adoc[Future]
* link:assets/docs/CompletionStage.adoc[CompletionStage]
* link:assets/docs/CompletableFuture.adoc[CompletableFuture]

A special lookup for exception handling:

== What is a Code-Kata

A code-kata is a coding exercise that builds muscle memory by a practice of programming to arrive
at a known solution.

=== How does one go about with this code kata?

The essence of the exercise (presentation material and code kata) is to demonstrate the
usage patterns for the java API or functionality.

This set of code katas rely on fixing broken tests. The tests may have multiple solutions, the
intent is to learn and experiment.

The project contains several JUnit tests that fail.

==== Simple steps to use this kata

. Run the test class(es).
. One or more tests will fail with the test failure message.
. Fix the failing tests by using `HINT` and `TODO` comments.
. Repeat above steps until all tests pass.
. Check the solutions to see if there are other ways to solve.
(Remember, the solution may be less performant/optimal than yours)
. Rinse and repeat (delete and checkout again, then back to Step 1) to build muscle memory.

=== Mission
> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to fix the JUnit tests. This
message will self-destruct in `**NaN**` minutes.

== Requirements
